    """
    Search the web for current market data, industry statistics, growth
    rates, trend information, and news. Returns AI-extracted summaries
    with source URLs and relevance scores.

    Use this tool for:
    - Market size and valuation figures
    - Industry growth rate data
    - Recent market trends and shifts
    - Regulatory or macro environment context
    - Recent competitor or industry news (topic="news")
    - Financial market data (topic="finance")

    Do NOT use for competitor-specific research — use
    serper_competitor_lookup for that. Do NOT use for brand-specific
    internal data — use get_brand_memory for that.

    Args:
        query: Specific search query. Be precise — include year,
               industry, and metric type for best results.
               Example: "marketing automation software market size 2024 USD"
        topic: Search index to use.
               "general" — broad web (default)
               "news"    — recent news articles only
               "finance" — financial data and market reports
        max_results: Number of results to return. Default 5 is usually
                     sufficient. Increase to 10 for broad topics.
