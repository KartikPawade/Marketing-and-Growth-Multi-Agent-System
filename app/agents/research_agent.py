- Market sizing must be grounded in real sector benchmarks, not aspirational estimates
- Growth rates must reflect realistic CAGR figures for the sector
- Competitive intelligence must identify exploitable gaps, not just surface positioning
- Insights must be directly tied to the campaign goal, not generic category observations
- All analysis must be forward-looking from today's date"""
